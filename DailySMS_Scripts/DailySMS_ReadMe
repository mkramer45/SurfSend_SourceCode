Daily SMS Alert Scripts:

Each beach available for monitoring on the website will have its' respective script that is run each morning... For now, only including Nantasket as an example.

If a registered user has a particular beach selected & the beach satisfies the criteria for good waves, they will get an SMS text message notification via its' corresponding script.

If the surf conditions do not meet the criteria for good surfing, no SMS text message will be sent.
